This is my IteratorProject.

In order to run the TestArrayList, TestTreeMap, or TestHashMap classes all you have
to do is go to the Application class and create a new TestArrayList, TestTreeMap or TestHashMap class
then use the run() method, it will then run the program.

If you would like to further modify the applications, you would need to go inside each of the 
individual classes and modify them to your liking.
